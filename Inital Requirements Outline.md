#### General Public Auctioning and Seller Site

### 1. Project Overview 

The software project we are developing is a Euro-centric e-commerce and auctioning site that will allow users to register as shoppers or sellers. We split the project into front-end and back-end components. The front-end handles the templates and route handling, and the back-end package handles the database interaction and API. The site is not currently using the back-end package.

Any person can use the site; however, they must register to purchase or sell any item. Unauthenticated users can view products and seller information.
