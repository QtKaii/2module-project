# README

Since one of us, Kai, was an experienced developer we decided to lean on his experience. We used concepts that were not covered in the lectures. This include using twig for templating webpages, and uploading images for products.
We used index.php as a "main" part, used primarily for routing to other pages, creating or calling classes and passing on information like session,classes and db to webpages. Given Kai's experience we followed his guidance. He went throught with us on how we use twig and github. He also taught us how to use sqlite which was a far more convinent way to used databases. We used templates for css as well to give our website and overall professional look.

## Pranav
Lecturer(Robert) let us know that we could use sqlite as long as we have atleat one instance of using PDO. PDO was used in commentDB.php.
